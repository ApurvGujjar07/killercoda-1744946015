kubectl port-forward service/nginx-service -n nginx 80:80 --address=0.0.0.0

Here's what it does:

kubectl port-forward: Forwards one or more local ports to a pod or service.

service/nginx-service: Targets the Kubernetes service named nginx-service.

-n nginx: Specifies the namespace nginx.

80:80: Forwards local port 80 to service port 80.

--address=0.0.0.0: Makes the forwarded port accessible on all network interfaces, not just localhost.

ðŸš¨ Security note: Using --address=0.0.0.0 exposes the service to anyone who can reach the machine's IP. Use with caution, especially on public or shared systems.
