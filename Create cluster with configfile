##Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the actions you’ve taken and their results:

**Created a Directory:**

mkdir kind-cluster

This created a directory named kind-cluster to store your Kubernetes cluster-related files.

**Navigated to the Directory:**

cd kind-cluster

You moved into the kind-cluster directory to work on the cluster setup.

**Created a Config File: You opened --> " config.yml with Vim" to configure your Kubernetes cluster. This file defines the cluster setup, including the number of nodes and their roles.

Created the Kubernetes Cluster:

kind create cluster --name=tws-cluster --config=config.yml
This command created the Kubernetes cluster named tws-cluster using the configuration in config.yml.
